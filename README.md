Veeeam Scripts  

*Use at your own risk!!!!*

#########################  hardened-check.sh #############################################

The hardened-check.sh script was created to highlight possible configuration errors in the hardened repository, they are basic checks based on official Veeam guides:
Reference guides:
-https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/hardened_repository_deploy.html?ver=110
-https://www.veeam.com/wp-guide-protect-ransomware-immutable-backups.html?wpty

This script does not replace any type of hardened that you should apply, for a more accurate hardened you should consult the your security team, in addition to the operating system manufacturer.
